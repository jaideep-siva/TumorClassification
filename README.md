# TumorClassification

##This project is about predicting if there is the presence of a tumor in a given MRI
### Approach 
* Since the data set only contains 250 data and had imbalanced classes it was important to address these issues
  1. Augment images to create a balanced class
  2. Crop images to ROI to reduce noise in deep learning models
  3. Implement different network architectures to compare and contrast performance
