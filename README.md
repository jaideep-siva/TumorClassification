# Tumor Classification

Welcome to the overview of Tumor Classification, presented by Jaideep Siva Senthil. This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning models to accurately classify tumors from MRI scans. Here, we detail our approach, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, and discuss future directions.

## Project Analysis

The project kicks off with an in-depth analysis, setting the stage for our objectives and methodologies.

### Project Overview

We initiated our journey by delineating the key phases of our project:

- Data Acquisition and Cleaning
- Model Training and Baseline Establishment
- Evaluation of Advanced Models
- Future Scope Exploration

### Project Workflow

Our workflow is a structured approach to tackling the classification challenge, beginning with data collection and culminating in model evaluation.

- **Data Preparation**: MRI scans were collected, featuring both tumor and non-tumor cases. A concerted effort was made to clean and preprocess this data for model training.
- **Model Development**: Starting with a baseline CNN model, we progressively explored more complex architectures like VGG and ResNet, applying transfer learning to enhance performance.

## Data Cleaning and Augmentation

A critical step in our process was preparing the data to ensure robust model training. This included resizing, augmentation, and splitting the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Our exploration spanned several models, each evaluated for its efficacy in tumor classification.

- **Baseline Model**: We established a baseline with a custom CNN to gauge the performance of more sophisticated models.
- **Advanced Models**: Implementations of VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 followed, with each model's performance meticulously analyzed.



## Results and Future Scope

Findings reveal promising directions for future research, including the integration of explainable AI, hyperparameter tuning, and the development of a full-stack application.
